# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short snippet of assembly code.  The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on the `ecx` register, which is used as an index into memory.  Improper input could lead to reading or writing outside the intended memory region.

## Vulnerability

The core issue lies in the instruction `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]`.  If `ecx` holds a value that results in an address outside the allocated memory region, this will cause a buffer overflow.  This could lead to various problems, including program crashes, data corruption, and potential security exploits.

## Solution

A robust solution involves thoroughly validating the value of `ecx` before using it in memory access calculations.  This usually involves checking against upper and lower bounds of the array or buffer to prevent out-of-bounds access. The improved code adds this validation step.
